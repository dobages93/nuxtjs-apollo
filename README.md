# nuxt-demo1

My Nuxt.js playground project. I have added a GraphQL server and apollo-client
v2 to communicate with it via vue-apollo.

## Requirements

You need a local mongodb server running on the default port.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:4000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).
